# US-COVID-Case-Visualization
Web Visualization of US COVID Cases by State

Data from three sources:
1. Data on Cases by Day fron the [NY Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv)
2. Data on Lockdown Dates from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lin0li/us-lockdown-dates-dataset)
    - This was augmented by me to add in 8 missing states that did not have stay at home orders
3. Data on Reopening Dates from Rearc on [AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/COVID-19-United-States-Reopen-and-Shut-Down-Status/prodview-ejbvrkmiwc5so)

These datasets were condenced and combined to create the final visualization.
